# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in RideXpress. We are continously looking to improve the project in different ways such as:  
- Fixing bugs
- Reviewing and updating documentation
- Coding new components
- Creating content for Meetups

I you would like to contribute please open an issue in this repo so the team can give you access to the GitHub team and Anypoint Platform.

Every contribution counts and every voice and opinion is valuable so we meet regularly to discuss several topics around Requirements, Architecture, Best practices and also experiences in general. We don't expect you to join to all the calls but catching up in a call has been very valuable for the team.

In general, we use Github issues to create working items we assign during the calls, we discuss the working items to get different perspectives around the solution but we can also help out in case you are learning and need additional support. Every issue should create a feature branch that will require at least one review from another teammate to be merged into the develop branches.

The practice we started using was to create feature branches directly from Github as follows:

From the issues page click on `Create branch`

<img src="images/issues-create-branch.png" alt="drawio github mode" width="300"/>

That will open a dialog to create the remote branch. Use the default values and click on `Create branch`:

<img src="images/issues-checkout-locally.png" alt="drawio github mode" width="300"/>

Copy and paste the following commands in your terminal (If you are not using a Desktop client):

<img src="images/issues-fetch-checkout.png" alt="drawio github mode" width="300"/>
