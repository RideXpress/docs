# General Guidelines

In order to control our contributions and measure the project progress, the following guidelines should be used:

## Tasks:

A task is a minimum piece of work worked by a contributor, this task will have some metrics to keep them on track:

Size estimation: Contributors use points to estimate their issues with the following guidelines:
1 point is 2 hours of work, 2 points 4 hours of work, 3 and 5. 
A task shouldn't be long enough to be finished in multiple sprints, if that happens, the task should be splitted.
Complexity will be proportional to the amounts of points assigned but not strictly.

Definition of done:
Every task should have detailed explanation of what needs to be accomplished of a task, the following can used as examples:

Define RAML object for user
Complete Deisgn Document for Payments API
Deploy square-system-api
Write Unit tests for square-system-api
Implementation ffor square-system-api


## Sprints:

Every sprint will last two weeks starting.
In Github every sprint is a field of type iteration and someone from the team needs to create new sprints if needed.

Every developer should assign the task to the desired sprint.

## Progress meetings:

In order to maximize the time we spend working together, async communication would be preferred to talk about tasks progress, 
blockers or comments. Slack workflows is a great way to do it.
