## Solution Architecture

TODO: Link to diagram

### Integration Platform Capabilities

The integration platform is presumed to encompass and facilitate a range of capabilities:

- **Connectivity:** Fundamental for linking various systems and applications.
- **API Design and Management:** Tools and protocols for creating and overseeing APIs.
- **Discovery and Reuse:** Mechanisms for identifying and repurposing existing assets.
- **Monitoring:** Oversight of system health and transaction flow.
- **Enterprise Security:** Protocols and measures to safeguard data and interactions.

### Patterns

The Integration Platform is expected to support the following patterns, tailored to meet specific connectivity needs:

- **Synchronous Request-Reply:** A real-time, two-way communication pattern.
- **Fire and Forget:** Sending a message without waiting for a response.
- **Message with Asynchronous Callback:** A message is sent, and the response is handled independently from the initial request.
- **Messaging Publish-Subscribe:** Distributing messages to multiple recipients through a subscription model.
- **Process Orchestration:** Coordinating various services and processes into a cohesive workflow.
- **Reliable Messaging:** Zero tolerance for message loss. Even if the message is received from a nontransactional connector.

### Connectivity
This document presumes that the Integration Platform will provide support for the following connectivity technologies:

- Salesforce
    - Platform Events
    - Streaming APIs
    - sObject CRUD operations
    - Bulk API
    - Composite API
- Database
    - Poll for changes plus CRUD operations
- SFTP
    - Poll, read, write, move operations
- Square REST API
    - CRUD operation
- Okta 
    - REST API for CRUD operation
    - Platform security OAuth configuration
- Google Maps
    - REST API for CRUD operation

### Technical Capabilities

In addition to the above, the integration platform is expected to support the following technical capabilities:

- Data mapping and transformation
- Support for a wide range of standard protocols including SOAP, REST
- Unit testing, including the ability to simulate external dependencies
- CI/CD integration for automated testing and deployment
- Support for full API lifecycle from conception to deployment
- Exchange API contracts with consumers to support API development
- Automatic generation of mock APIs
- Routing and orchestration
- Event logging and monitoring
- Analytics
