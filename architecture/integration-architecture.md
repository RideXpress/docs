## Introduction

This document describes the proposed integration architecture to support the RideXPress project. The integration solution is split into the following aspects:

- The proposed to-be logical integration processes and associated mechanisms for getting data into and out of the different systems that provide support to the RideXpress solution in a way that is agnostic of the integration layer; it is assumed that the integration platform supports all the required integration capabilities.
- The mechanism for functionally implementing these integration processes using MuleSoft as the integration platform.
- A proposed CloudHub-based platform reference architecture for deploying MuleSoft as the integration platform.

Note that any changes to ways of working as well as other organizational and operating model changes that are required to optimally deliver and maintain an integration platform whilst maximizing business agility are outside the scope of this document.


### Key Business Drivers
The key business drivers for this initiative that are relevant for the integration platform are as follows:

- Create an API driven company
