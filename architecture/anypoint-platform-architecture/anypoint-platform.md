The Anypoint Platform has five major components and will be the core to future integration capabilities:
- **Anypoint Design center**: Comprehensive tools to develop APIs and integrations faster and easier
- **Exchange**: Marketplace of API and integration assets, promotes reuse of pre-built connectors, templates, examples, and APIs 
- **Anypoint Management center**: Manage and monitor your applications across the platform in a single place
- **Mule runtime engine & services**: Single runtime for your Mule applications, easily configurable, performant, and deployable anywhere
- **Anypoint MQ**: Anypoint Cloud based messaging platform, to support asynchronous messaging use cases such as queueing and publish-subscribe with fully hosted and managed cloud-based Message Queues and Exchanges
- **Object Store**: Mechanism for storing arbitrary objects in MuleSoft using key-value pairs
- **Security**: Safeguard sensitive information with layers of protection
- **Anypoint Connectors**: Provide a means to connect to endpoints from your integration applications. Connectors fall into different categories.
    - **Community**: MuleSoft or members of the MuleSoft community write and maintain the Community connectors. Connectors built by the community or MuleSoft are generally open-source, although each package may vary. Partner-built connectors may not be open-source. Contact the partner directly for more information. You do not need any special account or license to use a Community connector
    - **MuleSoft Certified**: MuleSoft Certified connectors are developed by MuleSoftâ€™s partners and developer community and are reviewed and certified by MuleSoft. For support, customers should contact the MuleSoft partner that created the MuleSoft Certified connector.
    - **Select**: MuleSoft maintains Select connectors. Connectors included in the open source Mule distribution can be used by everyone, however support is only included in an Anypoint Platform subscription.
    - **Premium**: MuleSoft maintains Premium connectors; you must have an active CloudHub Premium plan or an Enterprise subscription with an entitlement for the specific connector you wish to use.
